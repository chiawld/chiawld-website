        <p>
          This is a personal project of mine, where I am dabbling in web development and trying to create a first website myself.
          I'm a second year Informatics and Social Sciences student at the University of Zurich. 
          My major is Software Systems and my minor is a blend of history, society and politics.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          After having grown up in Basel, I moved to Zurich two years ago for my studies.
          However, with my mother being from the Philippines and my father being from Canada,
          I have spent most of my life travelling a lot with family scattered all over the world.
          Despite chosing a very maths-focussed academic path from middle school onwards, my true passion lay within
          philosophy and politics. Already in primary school I began being involved in local and school politics. This would later
          lead to my decision of interdisciplinary studies at university. 
        </p>
        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>
          My path to Computer Science started barely two years ago, when I was already at university.
          Having first started a maths degree, I had to take an Introduction to Programming course, where 
          I learnt the basics of Python. It was there that I did a basic program, which most will be very familiar with,
          for the first time: I printed "Hello World". Nothing more, nothing less. Soon after, I discovered that I enjoyed
          the magic of creating things and solving problems with just a few words and numbers on my laptop much more than I 
          did calculations and proofs. So I switched to Computer Science. Even then, with no role models or much knowledge, 
          I could not imagine majoring in it. I kept a Political Science major with an Informatics minor. Again, I quickly
          came to realise that I still enjoyed programming and all aspects of computer science more than I did learning about politics.
          As much as I enjoyed the act of living politics! So with the support of my family and friends, I dared the switch to an Informatics
          major and have not regretted it since.
        </p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, I have gathered experience working in gastronomie and service. However, since April 2024, I have been working at a local NGO in Zurich called Girls Code Too.
          Their mission is to motivate young girls to explore technology and bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. It has been a great pleasure
          teaching summer courses or in weekly after-school classes at local primary schools in Zurich. 
        </p>
        <h2>Social engagement</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of my studies and work, I have the privilege of being able to invest my time into various social engagements 
          in university life.

          In autumn 2024, I joined the board of the Informatics Club (ICU) in the Studies position. After having received so much support
          and community from this association in my first year of my studies, I am even more excited to be able to give back from the other
          side. As part of my membership in the ICU, I am also a member in the student council of the UZH, the VSUZH 
          (Verband der Studierenden Schweiz). The ICU is part of the second largest fraction (fvoec x ICU) in this council of 70 seats, 
          having 14 seats shared with the economics association (fvoec). As of autumn 2024, after having been an active representative from 
          almost a year, I took over the co-lead of the fraction together with a fellow co-lead from the fvoec. 

          In spring 2024, together with fellow co-students, I founded the local task force of the University
          of Zurich as part of the Una Europa alliance.

        <h2>Personal interests</h2>
        <p>
          I was an avid rower for almost 8 years of my life.
